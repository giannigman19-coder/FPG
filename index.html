<h2>Athlete's Edge</h2>
	<p>I am creating a sports store. At my store I will have gear for most sports and athletic gear and shoes. I feel that there are only a couple stores to get athletic gear but are all very epensive. I want to make an affordable place where you can get all your athletic gear. With your first purshase with us you will get 35% off.   

<h3>Apparel</h3>
	<p>At our store we focus on sports equipment. We will have equipment for the following sports. We will have Football Baseball Basketball Softabll Volleyball and Soccer equipment.</p>

<h3>Reviews</h3>

Here are a few sample reviews for "Athlete's Edge" based on the information provided on the flyer:

The new go-to for athletes! Great selection and unbeatable value. Athlete's Edge is exactly what the local sports community needed. Their selection for multiple sports like basketball, soccer, and volleyball is extensive, and I was genuinely shocked at how affordable everythin was—especially after taking advantage of the 35% off first-purchase promotion. The focus on making gear accessible is clear. I found top-tier softball equipment that would have cost significantly more at major national chains. Highly recommend this store! 

Solid gear, friendly staff, just check the hours! I picked up some much-needed Football equipment here. The quality is fantastic and the prices are a breath of fresh air compared to other expensive sports stores in the area. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the gear. The only reason I didn't give a 5/5 is that the hours are a bit unconventional (closed on Mondays and Sundays) definitely need to plan your visit, but the savings are totally worth it! </p>
